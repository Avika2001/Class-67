**Story**

Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who recited in a berry tree, which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest, lived a crocodile and his wife. 

One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.

The monkey saw the crocodile underneath his tree.
